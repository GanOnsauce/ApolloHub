You are on the Stable-1.3 Branch. This is how ApolloHub (Then HTML-Games) was like (THERES NO WEBSITE FOR THIS PULL REQUEST)

# HTML Games
A repository where you can find a whole buncha HTML games. In Each folder you will find 2 things. A README with  the contols and where to find it online and the actual game. All of these games can be found online below. But they are also here and less laggy.
