Thx Doggo
Alright, I have a friend and he made a game on scratch. You can find his amazing projects <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/doggoMann18/">HERE</a>.
As a joke I decided to remix the game and put something very random.

To control the game  W A S D to move, don't get hit by the circle. GLHF
