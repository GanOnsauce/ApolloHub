Hey all, GanOnsauce here!
<br>
I've been working on a larger scale game, and I can't draw very well, let alone do background art. So I asked my friend <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/NinjeHades/">NinjeHades</a> (<a href="https://github.com/LegitFrodo">Legitfrodo</a> on GitHub) to do the background art and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/wwe-fan/">wwe-fan </a> 
 to do music (listen below). Overall it was a team effort and I really enjoy the game. I was a bit scared releasing it upfront so I got a team of play testers and gave constructive critisim. I plan to do a full release along side apollohub 2.5 sometime in late January. I will see you in 2.5 BYE!!
